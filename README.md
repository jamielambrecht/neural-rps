# RPS Image Detection Game

## Introduction

## Dependencies
Python 3.9.9

### Pip packages
opencv-python
tensorflow
numpy
sklearn
scipy

## Installation
Install the correct version of Python and ensure that you can run Python files (may require configuring the OS or shell environment variables, i.e. adding python to your "PATH".). Install the Python package installer "pip" using the command "python -m ensurepip --upgrade". The name of the python command may be "python3" on some Linux distributions, etc. Use pip to install the dependencies. This can be done using the provided file "requirements.txt" with the following command: "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt" or just "pip install -r requirements.txt" (If pip is also in your PATH). This program was tested on Windows 11 and Fedora Linux 35 and was found to need no further configuration. We can not guarantee compatability of the libraries with any particular hardware/operating system configurations.

## Usage
Run the program using "python main.py". The application UI is fragmented so interaction with the program occurs in both the terminal as well as in windows that will appear at different stages of the program. Warnings regarding Nvidia GPU drivers are likely and can be ignored.
